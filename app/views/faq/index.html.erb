  <b>General Disclaimer</b>
  <p>I do not own any of the images obtained from this site - they are all obtained from ArkhamDB and are the intellectual property of Fantasy Flight Games. Proxies cards are never to be sold, nor to be used in a way to defraud someone into thinking they are real. Please support the company and buy their product when possible.</p>
  <i><b>How do I use this website?</b></i>
  <p>Go to ArkhamDB.com and sign in, then make a deck. Get the URL for the deck, something like 'https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/53872' and paste that into the tool. You could also just find individual cards via the search function and grabbing their ID's from the URL. For example, the ID for this card 'https://arkhamdb.com/card/01024' is 01024.</p>
  <p>After you have your PDF, you should print it out on normal printer paper and cut the cards out. To use the proxied cards in a deck with other regular cards, I'd recommend sleeving your investigator deck (with something like <a href="https://www.dragonshield.com/en-us">Dragon Shields</a>) then inserting the printed card on top of an existing card.</p>
  <i><b>Why do the cards have white in the corners? Could it have a black background between the cards?</i></b>
  <p>Most of the images from ArkhamDB actually have white corners already in the images - they were scanned in that way. I could probably do some image processing to make those white corners transparent and then I could make a black background between all the cards. But as above - that is a future improvement. Also note that same card images have rounded corners and some don't - this is out of my control.</p>
  <i><b>How can I report a problem?</i></b>

  <i><b>Why did you make this project?</i></b>
  <p>I love <a href="https://mtgprint.net/">mtgprint.net</a> and wanted something similar to it for Arkham Horror. This was inspired by https://gitlab.com/ahiskali/arkham-proxy which is now a dead project.</p>
  <p> I am also currently unemployed and working on small projects to practice my skills.</p>
