With his trusty camera in tow, he will not rest until he has captured photographic evidence of the horrors that dwell in the shadows of his hometown and beyond. Just one good shot is all he needs.",

She purchased a boat with her friend, Annalise Taylor, and the two found a new home among the city's fishing community. One stormy night at sea, Annalise was pulled overboard by a strange fish-like creature. Marion leapt into the water and pulled Annalise from the creature's jaws - costing Marion her right arm. Since then, she keeps a weather eye on the choppy waters of the Atlantic and the strange creatures that hide in its depths.",
